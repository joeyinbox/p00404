				<h2>What is a Logic Gate?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Logic gates are fundamental building block of digital circuit which control the flow of electricity through circuits. 
			They are based on Boolean algebra logic. The computer systems have thousands of these logic gates constructed together which help them to processes different tasks logically. 
			The data is converted to binary form (1s and 0s) in computers which is then process logically according to the logic gates arrangement.
			The logic gates make use of Boolean algebra operations such as AND, OR and NOT to control the flow of electricity through circuits. 
			There are basic seven types of logic gates:</p>

			<section id="not-gate">
				<h1>NOT Gate</h1>
				<p>NOT gate make use of NOT (negation) operator of Boolean algebra. It takes single true or false value and the result is always the opposite of the
				input according to Boolean logic of NOT. So it basically inverts the input value. The symbol for NOT gate is normally given as below.  It is written as ~A..</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>

			<section id="and-gate">
				<h1>AND Gate</h1>
				<p>AND gate make use of AND (Conjunction) operator of Boolean algebra. It can take two inputs true or false values and output the correspondence result based on the Boolean logic. 
				The symbol for AND gate is usually as below. It is written as A & B.</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
				<p>(A & B)</p>
				<div>
					<div id="and-gate-canvas-results"></div>
					<canvas id="and-gate-canvas"></canvas>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="nand-gate">
				<h1>NAND Gate</h1>
				<p>NAND gate is the inverse of AND gate. It can tak two input 0 or 1 value and out the correspondence result based on the logic which is normally 
				the opposite of the AND gate. It is written as A|B. The symbol is normally as below. The little circle in the output represent that it is inverse of AND..</p>

				<p>(A | B)</p>

			</section>
			<section id="or-gate">
				<h1>OR Gate</h1>
				<p>OR gate make use of OR (disjunction) operator of Boolean algebra. It can also take two inputs true or false values as (1s and 0s) and output
				the correspondence result based on the Boolean logic. The symbol for OR gate is normally given as below. It is written as A+B.</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
				<p>(A + B)</p>
				<div>
					<div id="or-gate-canvas-results"></div>
					<canvas id="or-gate-canvas"></canvas>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="nor-gate">
				<h1>NOR Gate</h1>
				<p>Similarly NOR gate is the inverse of OR gate. It can take two input values as  0s and 1s and the result is always the opposite than the OR gate.
				It is written as A-B. the symbol is normally as below..</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
				<p>(A - B)</p>
				<div>
					<div id="nor-gate-canvas-results"></div>
					<canvas id="nor-gate-canvas"></canvas>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="xor-gate">
				<h1>XOR Gate</h1>
				<p>The XOR gate called exclusive OR is like an OR gate but only gives a true output if either a or b has true input. If both have true input
				the result c will be false. If both have false input the result again will be false. It is written as A(+)B. The symbol is normally as given below..</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
				<p>A (+) B</p>
				<div>
					<div id="xor-gate-canvas-results"></div>
					<canvas id="xor-gate-canvas"></canvas>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="xnor-gate">
				<h1>XNOR Gate</h1>
				<p>XNOR gate is inverter of XOR gate as it has a circle in the symbol.  It can take two inputs and the result is always the opposite of XOR gate.
				It is written as A(.)B. the symbol is normally as given below..</p>
				<h2>Algebraic notation</h2>
				<p>A (.) B</p>
